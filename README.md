# Blogolio
This is my personal web blog page! The project contains code for single blog web pages within a flux architecture, using React + ES6. The images do have a copyright from its origin artist. Do not use them. Thanks!

Go to the development branch to find out how this static web page is actually built. A tutorial will follow, stay tuned.
