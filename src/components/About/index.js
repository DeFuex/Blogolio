					I'm a web/mobile (mostly Android) developer from Austria and I always look for ways to improve my skills in certain technologies.
					<br/>
					<br/>
					I recently finished my masters degree and I'm currently working at Ebcont Technologies GmbH, a consulting company which develops many customer based services in the fields of software, mobile and web development.
					<br/>
					<br/>
					During my time as student i had the chance to study abroad in South Korea at Korea University for 1 semester. I could get an insight on some cultural differences and travel to nearby areas, different places and also Japan. Overall, it was a nice experience and my stopover in Japan gave me motivation to finally enroll myself into a japanese language course back in my hometown Vienna. Learning a third language never can't be that bad actually...
					<br/>
					<br/>
					Besides my little adventures, my passions are -
					<br/>
					<br/>
					<ul>
						<li>Developing Android applications.</li>
						<li>Drawing and a little bit 3D modelling to it.</li>
						<li>I'm also interested in the field of Computer Graphic programming.</li>
						<li>Sometimes I play Counter Strike Global Offensive with friends.</li>
						<li>If the time allows it i do sports like endurance and strength training or skiing in winter.</li>
						<li>And of course, learning Japanese</li>
					</ul>
